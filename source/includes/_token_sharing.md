## Acqisition done via FS App

To Receive the Tokens:
The following is a generic format with which we can share the Token.
We have a handshake id generated by us. This will be used in the communication till we get the
verified_customer_reference_id from your system. Once confirmed we will use the
verified_customer_reference_id to send the token.

### Handshake
